## Image - Preservation Action Plan

#### Introduction

This document describes the preservation plan for image content in the York University Digital Library. Most of the image content content is from the Clara Thomas Archives and Special Collections. The preservation plan for image content follows from policies and practices described in the [Digital Preservation Strategic Plan]($repo_urldocumentation/digital-preservation-implementation-plan) and the [Digital Preservation Implementation Plan]($repo_urldocumentation/digital-preservation-implementation-plan). This document explains practical steps that $institution take to preserve the intellectual content of image in digital format. It outlines the basic tools, methods, and standards used for the long-term preservation of image content.

#### Content Formats

For the preservation of image content, $institution require uncompressed TIF versions of the content, and descriptive metadata. During the ingest process, derivatives are created for display. $institution continuously monitors developments in file formats to determine if and when formats require migration (see [Environmental Monitoring of Preservation Formats]($repo_urldocumentation/environmental-monitoring-preservation-formats)).

#### SIP Format

Image SIPs (see [Definition of SIP]($repo_urlcontent/definition-sip)) generally consist of a TIF file, and an associated MODS descriptive metadata file.

#### Analysis on Ingest

Upon ingest, every file in the repository is subject to identification of its file format and validation using FITS. The output of the FITS identification and validation processes are recorded to a techincal metadata datastream (TECHMD_FITS) that is associated with the object in the repository.

#### Content Excluded

$institution do not ingest files that are not referenced (either as part of a representation or as associated datastreams) in the associated metadata. As the SIP is retained, these files can later be ingested if necessary.

#### Format Normalization

There is no format normailziation if the submitted object is a TIF.

#### Metadata Normalization

When necessary, $institution crosswalk descriptive metadata from MODS to Dublin Core. The repository creates preservation metadata for each file. The preservation level, explained in the [Digital Preservation Implementation Plan]($repo_urlcontent/digital-preservation-implementation-plan), is applied to each file upon ingest and recorded in the preservation metadata for each file.

#### Acceptable Formats

For the Full Preservation level for image, currently the acceptable formats are TIF. Image submissions may be JPG or PNG format, however they will be preserved at the Bit-level Preservation level.
