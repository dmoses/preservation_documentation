## Digital Preservation Rights Policy

#### $repo Digital Preservation: Rights Policy

As outlined in the [Preservation Implementation Plan]($repo_urlcontent/digital-preservation-implementation-plan), $institution’s digital preservation strategies are based around the transformation of ingested content into file formats conducive to long term preservation, in addition to standard bit-level preservation. In order to enable the full realization of this strategy, there is one right that need to be acquired from the content providers:

#### Transformation

Content providers granting this right have consented to having their content migrated to new formats for the purposes of long-term preservation. In the interest of long-term preservation, it is important that $institution be allowed to transform files in its care from formats deemed as being in the danger of becoming obsolete into ones more suited to long-term interpretability. This is the right necessary to enable the “full” preservation level.

Without this right having been assigned, $institution can only ensure file integrity, no the preservation of the intellectual contents of an archival unit.
